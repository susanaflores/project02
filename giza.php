    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8 million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient monuments in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the plateau have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers' quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with amazing precision and skill but, once it became associated with the great kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the attention of less prominent officals of lower rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      These officials had enough money and prestige to buy their way into burial plots at Giza but had no regard for the symmetry of the original schematics and had their tombs dug wherever they found available space. This resulted ina number of grave complexes throughout Giza which would not have been authorized by the kings who built the famous pyramids which, thorughout history, have drawn vistors from around the world.

    <h2>Geography & Demographics</h2>
    <p>
      The city of Giza is the capital of the Giza Governorate, and is located near the northeast border of this governorate. Technically, Giza may not be an incorporated municipal unit, and therefore not a city at all. In a typical Egyptian fashion, there are two districts within the Governorate with the same name: a kism/qasm and associated markiz. Some 9 urban kisms of Giza Governorate form collectively a contiguous area of 98.4 km2 on the Nile directly opposite Cairo, and recorded a preliminary count of 4,146,340 in 2017 census count, not including the Al-Ḥawāmidiyah kism separated by Giza markiz.
    </p>

    <p>
      The city's population was reported as 2,681,863 in the 2006 national census, while the governorate had 6,272,571 at the same census, without specifying what the city is.

    <h2>Climate</h2>
    <p>
        Giza experiences a hot desert climate like arid climate (Köppen: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Wind storms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while nighttime lows drop to below 7 °C (45 °F).
      </p>

      <p>
        In summer, the highs are 40 °C (104 °F), and the lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow and freezing temperatures are extremely rare. Up to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 °C (36 °F) on 8 January 1966.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several pharaohs who ruled ancient Egypt, during the 2nd millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed Giza pyramid complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        As ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: Φυλακή) or Terso (Coptic: ϯⲣⲥⲱ, meaning "the fortress", now Tersa) was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.

    <p>
        Although the Giza plateau is most closely associated with the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the site was used as early as the First Dynasty of Egypt as evidenced by the tomb of the king Djet which was found toward the edge of the plateau. Evidence of at least one king from the Second Dynasty (Nynetjer) buried at Giza has also been found. Further, inscriptions relate how king Khufu had to clear many earlier tombs and grave complexes to build the Great Pyramid.
    </p>

    <p>
        What happened to the corpses or the grave goods from those tombs is not known. The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the pyramid of Cheops, the king's Greek name) is the last remaining of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World and rises to a height of 481 feet (147 metres). The pyramid of Khafre is 471 feet tall(144 metres) and that of Menkaure rises to 213 feet (65 metres). The Great Sphinx sits on the eastern side of the plateau apart from the pyramids but it is thought it once was an important part of the pyramid complex which covered the area.

    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    <p>
      Baladi Bread is one of the most popular foods in Egypt. It is normally served with every meal as a side or to dip into something like a soup, baba ganoush or stew. You are likely to be served Egyptian flatbread at breakfast time with soft cheese, eggs and tahini. You’ll also see it at lunch and dinner in Egypt. It’s actually one of our favourite breads in the world. And the hot fresh breads from the bakery above were a real treat.
